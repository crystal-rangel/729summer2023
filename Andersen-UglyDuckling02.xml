<kbng:maintext>
<kbng:paragraph>It was lovely summer weather in the country, and the golden corn, the green oats, and the haystacks piled up in the meadows looked beautiful. The stork walking about on his long red legs chattered in the Egyptian language, which he had learnt from his mother. The corn-fields and meadows were surrounded by large forests, in the midst of which were deep pools. It was, indeed, delightful to walk about in the country. In a sunny spot stood a 
pleasant old farm-house close by a deep river, and from the house down to the 
water side grew great burdock leaves, so high, that under the tallest of them a 
little child could stand upright. The spot was as wild as the centre of a thick 
wood. In this snug retreat sat a duck on her nest, watching for her young brood 
to hatch; she was beginning to get tired of her task, for the little ones were a 
long time coming out of their shells, and she seldom had any visitors. The other 
ducks liked much better to swim about in the river than to climb the slippery 
banks, and sit under a burdock leaf, to have a gossip with her. At length one 
shell cracked, and then another, and from each egg came a living creature that 
lifted its head and cried, <kbng:speech>“Peep, peep.”</kbng:speech> <kbng:speech>“Quack, quack,”</kbng:speech> said the mother, and then they all quacked as well as they could, and looked about them on every side at the large green leaves. Their mother allowed them to look as much as they liked, because green is good for the eyes. <kbng:speech>“How large the world is,”</kbng:speech> said the young ducks, when they found how much more room they now had than while they were inside the egg-shell. <kbng:speech>“Do you imagine this is the whole world?”</kbng:speech> asked the mother; <kbng:speech>“Wait till you have seen the garden; it stretches far beyond that to the 
parson's field, but I have never ventured to such a distance. Are you all out?” </kbng:speech>
she continued, rising; <kbng:speech>“No, I declare, the largest egg lies there still. I 
wonder how long this is to last, I am quite tired of it;”</kbng:speech> and she seated herself 
again on the nest.</kbng:paragraph>

<kbng:paragraph><kbng:speech>“Well, how are you getting on?”</kbng:speech> asked an old duck, who paid her a visit. </kbng:paragraph>

 <kbng:paragraph><kbng:speech>“One egg is not hatched yet,”</kbng:speech> said the duck, <kbng:speech>“it will not break. But just 
look at all the others, are they not the prettiest little ducklings you ever 
saw? They are the image of their father, who is so unkind, he never comes to 
see.”</kbng:speech></kbng:paragraph>

 <kbng:paragraph><kbng:speech>“Let me see the egg that will not break,”</kbng:speech> said the duck; <kbng:speech>“I have no doubt it is a turkey's egg. I was persuaded to hatch some once, and after all my care and trouble with the young ones, they were afraid of the water. I quacked and 
clucked, but all to no purpose. I could not get them to venture in. Let me look 
at the egg. Yes, that is a turkey's egg; take my advice, leave it where it is 
and teach the other children to swim.”</kbng:speech> </kbng:paragraph>

 <kbng:paragraph><kbng:speech>“I think I will sit on it a little while longer,”</kbng:speech> said the duck; <kbng:speech>“as I have 
sat so long already, a few days will be nothing.”</kbng:speech> </kbng:paragraph>

 <kbng:paragraph><kbng:speech>“Please yourself,”</kbng:speech> said the old duck, and she went away. </kbng:paragraph> 
 
 <kbng:paragraph>At last the large egg broke, and a young one crept forth crying, <kbng:speech>“Peep, 
peep.” </kbng:speech>It was very large and ugly. The duck stared at it and exclaimed, <kbng:speech>“It is 
very large and not at all like the others. I wonder if it really is a turkey. We 
shall soon find it out, however when we go to the water. It must go in, if I 
have to push it myself.”</kbng:speech> </kbng:paragraph>

 <kbng:paragraph>On the next day the weather was delightful, and the sun shone brightly on the 
green burdock leaves, so the mother duck took her young brood down to the water, 
and jumped in with a splash. <kbng:speech>“Quack, quack,”</kbng:speech> cried she, and one after another 
the little ducklings jumped in. The water closed over their heads, but they came 
up again in an instant, and swam about quite prettily with their legs paddling 
under them as easily as possible, and the ugly duckling was also in the water 
swimming with them. </kbng:paragraph>

 <kbng:paragraph><kbng:speech>“Oh,”</kbng:speech> said the mother, <kbng:speech>“that is not a turkey; how well he uses his legs, and 
how upright he holds himself! He is my own child, and he is not so very ugly 
after all if you look at him properly. Quack, quack! come with me now, I will 
take you into grand society, and introduce you to the farmyard, but you must 
keep close to me or you may be trodden upon; and, above all, beware of the cat.”</kbng:speech> </kbng:paragraph>

<kbng:paragraph>When they reached the farmyard, there was a great disturbance, two families 
were fighting for an eel's head, which, after all, was carried off by the cat. 
<kbng:speech>“See, children, that is the way of the world,” </kbng:speech>said the mother duck, whetting her beak, for she would have liked the eel's head herself. <kbng:speech>“Come, now, use your 
legs, and let me see how well you can behave. You must bow your heads prettily 
to that old duck yonder; she is the highest born of them all, and has Spanish 
blood, therefore, she is well off. Don't you see she has a red flag tied to her 
leg, which is something very grand, and a great honor for a duck; it shows that 
every one is anxious not to lose her, as she can be recognized both by man and 
beast. Come, now, don't turn your toes, a well-bred duckling spreads his feet 
wide apart, just like his father and mother, in this way; now bend your neck, 
and say ‘quack.'” </kbng:speech></kbng:paragraph>

 <kbng:paragraph>The ducklings did as they were bid, but the other duck stared, and said, 
<kbng:speech>“Look, here comes another brood, as if there were not enough of us already! and 
what a queer looking object one of them is; we don't want him here,” </kbng:speech>and then 
one flew out and bit him in the neck. </kbng:paragraph>

 <kbng:paragraph><kbng:speech>“Leave him alone,” </kbng:speech>said the mother;<kbng:speech> “he is not doing any harm.” </kbng:speech></kbng:paragraph> 
 
 <kbng:paragraph><kbng:speech>“Yes, but he is so big and ugly,”</kbng:speech> said the spiteful duck <kbng:speech>“and therefore he 
must be turned out.”</kbng:speech> </kbng:paragraph> 

<kbng:paragraph><kbng:speech>“The others are very pretty children,”</kbng:speech> said the old duck, with the rag on her 
leg, <kbng:speech>“all but that one; I wish his mother could improve him a little.”</kbng:speech> </kbng:paragraph> 

<kbng:paragraph><kbng:speech>“That is impossible, your grace,” </kbng:speech>replied the mother; <kbng:speech>“he is not pretty; but 
he has a very good disposition, and swims as well or even better than the 
others. I think he will grow up pretty, and perhaps be smaller; he has remained 
too long in the egg, and therefore his figure is not properly formed;” </kbng:speech>and then 
she stroked his neck and smoothed the feathers, saying, <kbng:speech>“It is a drake, and 
therefore not of so much consequence. I think he will grow up strong, and able 
to take care of himself.” </kbng:speech></kbng:paragraph> 

<kbng:paragraph><kbng:speech>“The other ducklings are graceful enough,” </kbng:speech>said the old duck. <kbng:speech>“Now make 
yourself at home, and if you can find an eel's head, you can bring it to me.”</kbng:speech> </kbng:paragraph> 

<kbng:paragraph>And so they made themselves comfortable; but the poor duckling, who had crept 
out of his shell last of all, and looked so ugly, was bitten and pushed and made 
fun of, not only by the ducks, but by all the poultry. <kbng:speech>“He is too big,”</kbng:speech> they all 
said, and the turkey cock, who had been born into the world with spurs, and 
fancied himself really an emperor, puffed himself out like a vessel in full 
sail, and flew at the duckling, and became quite red in the head with passion, 
so that the poor little thing did not know where to go, and was quite miserable 
because he was so ugly and laughed at by the whole farmyard. So it went on from 
day to day till it got worse and worse. The poor duckling was driven about by 
every one; even his brothers and sisters were unkind to him, and would say,<kbng:speech> “Ah, 
you ugly creature, I wish the cat would get you,” </kbng:speech> and his mother said she wished 
he had never been born. The ducks pecked him, the chickens beat him, and the 
girl who fed the poultry kicked him with her feet. So at last he ran away, 
frightening the little birds in the hedge as he flew over the palings. </kbng:paragraph> 

<kbng:paragraph><kbng:speech>“They are afraid of me because I am ugly,” </kbng:speech>he said. So he closed his eyes, 
and flew still farther, until he came out on a large moor, inhabited by wild 
ducks. Here he remained the whole night, feeling very tired and sorrowful. </kbng:paragraph> 

<kbng:paragraph>In the morning, when the wild ducks rose in the air, they stared at their new 
comrade.<kbng:speech> “What sort of a duck are you?”</kbng:speech> they all said, coming round him. </kbng:paragraph> 

<kbng:paragraph>He bowed to them, and was as polite as he could be, but he did not reply to 
their question. <kbng:speech>“You are exceedingly ugly,”</kbng:speech> said the wild ducks, <kbng:speech>“but that will 
not matter if you do not want to marry one of our family.”</kbng:speech> </kbng:paragraph> 

<kbng:paragraph>Poor thing! he had no thoughts of marriage; all he wanted was permission to 
lie among the rushes, and drink some of the water on the moor. After he had been 
on the moor two days, there came two wild geese, or rather goslings, for they 
had not been out of the egg long, and were very saucy. <kbng:speech>“Listen, friend,”</kbng:speech> said 
one of them to the duckling, <kbng:speech>“you are so ugly, that we like you very well. Will 
you go with us, and become a bird of passage? Not far from here is another moor, 
in which there are some pretty wild geese, all unmarried. It is a chance for you 
to get a wife; you may be lucky, ugly as you are.” </kbng:speech></kbng:paragraph> 

<kbng:paragraph><kbng:speech>“Pop, pop,”</kbng:speech> sounded in the air, and the two wild geese fell dead among the 
rushes, and the water was tinged with blood. <kbng:speech>“Pop, pop,” </kbng:speech>echoed far and wide in 
the distance, and whole flocks of wild geese rose up from the rushes. The sound 
continued from every direction, for the sportsmen surrounded the moor, and some 
were even seated on branches of trees, overlooking the rushes. The blue smoke 
from the guns rose like clouds over the dark trees, and as it floated away 
across the water, a number of sporting dogs bounded in among the rushes, which 
bent beneath them wherever they went. How they terrified the poor duckling! He 
turned away his head to hide it under his wing, and at the same moment a large 
terrible dog passed quite near him. His jaws were open, his tongue hung from his 
mouth, and his eyes glared fearfully. He thrust his nose close to the duckling, 
showing his sharp teeth, and then, <kbng:speech>“splash, splash,”</kbng:speech> he went into the water 
without touching him, <kbng:speech>“Oh,”</kbng:speech> sighed the duckling,<kbng:speech> “how thankful I am for being so 
ugly; even a dog will not bite me.” </kbng:speech> And so he lay quite still, while the shot 
rattled through the rushes, and gun after gun was fired over him. It was late in 
the day before all became quiet, but even then the poor young thing did not dare 
to move. He waited quietly for several hours, and then, after looking carefully 
around him, hastened away from the moor as fast as he could. He ran over field 
and meadow till a storm arose, and he could hardly struggle against it. Towards 
evening, he reached a poor little cottage that seemed ready to fall, and only 
remained standing because it could not decide on which side to fall first. The 
storm continued so violent, that the duckling could go no farther; he sat down 
by the cottage, and then he noticed that the door was not quite closed in 
consequence of one of the hinges having given way. There was therefore a narrow 
opening near the bottom large enough for him to slip through, which he did very 
quietly, and got a shelter for the night. A woman, a tom cat, and a hen lived in 
this cottage. The tom cat, whom the mistress called, “My little son,” was a 
great favorite; he could raise his back, and purr, and could even throw out 
sparks from his fur if it were stroked the wrong way. The hen had very short 
legs, so she was called “Chickie short legs.” She laid good eggs, and her 
mistress loved her as if she had been her own child. In the morning, the strange 
visitor was discovered, and the tom cat began to purr, and the hen to cluck. </kbng:paragraph> 

<kbng:paragraph><kbng:speech>“What is that noise about?”</kbng:speech> said the old woman, looking round the room, but 
her sight was not very good; therefore, when she saw the duckling she thought it 
must be a fat duck, that had strayed from home. <kbng:speech>“Oh what a prize!”</kbng:speech> she 
exclaimed, <kbng:speech>“I hope it is not a drake, for then I shall have some duck's eggs. I 
must wait and see.”</kbng:speech> So the duckling was allowed to remain on trial for three 
weeks, but there were no eggs. Now the tom cat was the master of the house, and 
the hen was mistress, and they always said, <kbng:speech>“We and the world,”</kbng:speech> for they 
believed themselves to be half the world, and the better half too. The duckling 
thought that others might hold a different opinion on the subject, but the hen 
would not listen to such doubts. <kbng:speech>“Can you lay eggs?”</kbng:speech> she asked. <kbng:speech>“No.”</kbng:speech> <kbng:speech>“Then have 
the goodness to hold your tongue.”</kbng:speech> <kbng:speech>“Can you raise your back, or purr, or throw 
out sparks?” </kbng:speech>said the tom cat.<kbng:speech> “No.” </kbng:speech><kbng:speech>“Then you have no right to express an 
opinion when sensible people are speaking.” </kbng:speech>So the duckling sat in a corner, 
feeling very low spirited, till the sunshine and the fresh air came into the 
room through the open door, and then he began to feel such a great longing for a 
swim on the water, that he could not help telling the hen. </kbng:paragraph> 

<kbng:paragraph><kbng:speech>“What an absurd idea,”</kbng:speech> said the hen. <kbng:speech>“You have nothing else to do, therefore 
you have foolish fancies. If you could purr or lay eggs, they would pass away.”</kbng:speech> </kbng:paragraph> 

<kbng:paragraph><kbng:speech>“But it is so delightful to swim about on the water,”</kbng:speech> said the duckling, <kbng:speech>“and 
so refreshing to feel it close over your head, while you dive down to the 
bottom.” </kbng:speech></kbng:paragraph> 

<kbng:paragraph><kbng:speech>“Delightful, indeed!”</kbng:speech> said the hen,<kbng:speech> “why you must be crazy! Ask the cat, he 
is the cleverest animal I know, ask him how he would like to swim about on the 
water, or to dive under it, for I will not speak of my own opinion; ask our 
mistress, the old woman—there is no one in the world more clever than she is. Do 
you think she would like to swim, or to let the water close over her head?” </kbng:speech></kbng:paragraph> 

<kbng:paragraph><kbng:speech>“You don't understand me,” </kbng:speech>said the duckling. </kbng:paragraph> 

<kbng:paragraph><kbng:speech>“We don't understand you? Who can understand you, I wonder? Do you consider 
yourself more clever than the cat, or the old woman? I will say nothing of 
myself. Don't imagine such nonsense, child, and thank your good fortune that you 
have been received here. Are you not in a warm room, and in society from which 
you may learn something. But you are a chatterer, and your company is not very 
agreeable. Believe me, I speak only for your own good. I may tell you unpleasant 
truths, but that is a proof of my friendship. I advise you, therefore, to lay 
eggs, and learn to purr as quickly as possible.” </kbng:speech></kbng:paragraph> 

<kbng:paragraph><kbng:speech>“I believe I must go out into the world again,” </kbng:speech>said the duckling. </kbng:paragraph> 

<kbng:paragraph><kbng:speech>“Yes, do,” </kbng:speech>said the hen. So the duckling left the cottage, and soon found 
water on which it could swim and dive, but was avoided by all other animals, 
because of its ugly appearance. Autumn came, and the leaves in the forest turned 
to orange and gold. then, as winter approached, the wind caught them as they 
fell and whirled them in the cold air. The clouds, heavy with hail and 
snow-flakes, hung low in the sky, and the raven stood on the ferns crying, 
<kbng:speech>“Croak, croak.”</kbng:speech> It made one shiver with cold to look at him. All this was very 
sad for the poor little duckling. One evening, just as the sun set amid radiant 
clouds, there came a large flock of beautiful birds out of the bushes. The 
duckling had never seen any like them before. They were swans, and they curved 
their graceful necks, while their soft plumage shown with dazzling whiteness. 
They uttered a singular cry, as they spread their glorious wings and flew away 
from those cold regions to warmer countries across the sea. As they mounted 
higher and higher in the air, the ugly little duckling felt quite a strange 
sensation as he watched them. He whirled himself in the water like a wheel, 
stretched out his neck towards them, and uttered a cry so strange that it 
frightened himself. Could he ever forget those beautiful, happy birds; and when 
at last they were out of his sight, he dived under the water, and rose again 
almost beside himself with excitement. He knew not the names of these birds, nor 
where they had flown, but he felt towards them as he had never felt for any 
other bird in the world. He was not envious of these beautiful creatures, but 
wished to be as lovely as they. Poor ugly creature, how gladly he would have 
lived even with the ducks had they only given him encouragement. The winter grew 
colder and colder; he was obliged to swim about on the water to keep it from 
freezing, but every night the space on which he swam became smaller and smaller. 
At length it froze so hard that the ice in the water crackled as he moved, and 
the duckling had to paddle with his legs as well as he could, to keep the space 
from closing up. He became exhausted at last, and lay still and helpless, frozen 
fast in the ice. </kbng:paragraph> 

<kbng:paragraph>Early in the morning, a peasant, who was passing by, saw what had happened. 
He broke the ice in pieces with his wooden shoe, and carried the duckling home 
to his wife. The warmth revived the poor little creature; but when the children 
wanted to play with him, the duckling thought they would do him some harm; so he 
started up in terror, fluttered into the milk-pan, and splashed the milk about 
the room. Then the woman clapped her hands, which frightened him still more. He 
flew first into the butter-cask, then into the meal-tub, and out again. What a 
condition he was in! The woman screamed, and struck at him with the tongs; the 
children laughed and screamed, and tumbled over each other, in their efforts to 
catch him; but luckily he escaped. The door stood open; the poor creature could 
just manage to slip out among the bushes, and lie down quite exhausted in the 
newly fallen snow. </kbng:paragraph> 

<kbng:paragraph>It would be very sad, were I to relate all the misery and privations which 
the poor little duckling endured during the hard winter; but when it had passed, 
he found himself lying one morning in a moor, amongst the rushes. He felt the 
warm sun shining, and heard the lark singing, and saw that all around was 
beautiful spring. Then the young bird felt that his wings were strong, as he 
flapped them against his sides, and rose high into the air. They bore him 
onwards, until he found himself in a large garden, before he well knew how it 
had happened. The apple-trees were in full blossom, and the fragrant elders bent 
their long green branches down to the stream which wound round a smooth lawn. 
Everything looked beautiful, in the freshness of early spring. From a thicket 
close by came three beautiful white swans, rustling their feathers, and swimming 
lightly over the smooth water. The duckling remembered the lovely birds, and 
felt more strangely unhappy than ever. </kbng:paragraph> 

<kbng:paragraph><kbng:speech>“I will fly to those royal birds,”</kbng:speech> he exclaimed,<kbng:speech> “and they will kill me, 
because I am so ugly, and dare to approach them; but it does not matter: better 
be killed by them than pecked by the ducks, beaten by the hens, pushed about by 
the maiden who feeds the poultry, or starved with hunger in the winter.” </kbng:speech></kbng:paragraph> 

<kbng:paragraph>Then he flew to the water, and swam towards the beautiful swans. The moment 
they espied the stranger, they rushed to meet him with outstretched wings. </kbng:paragraph> 

<kbng:paragraph><kbng:speech>“Kill me,”</kbng:speech> said the poor bird; and he bent his head down to the surface of 
the water, and awaited death. </kbng:paragraph> 

<kbng:paragraph>But what did he see in the clear stream below? His own image; no longer a 
dark, gray bird, ugly and disagreeable to look at, but a graceful and beautiful 
swan. To be born in a duck's nest, in a farmyard, is of no consequence to a 
bird, if it is hatched from a swan's egg. He now felt glad at having suffered 
sorrow and trouble, because it enabled him to enjoy so much better all the 
pleasure and happiness around him; for the great swans swam round the new-comer, 
and stroked his neck with their beaks, as a welcome. </kbng:paragraph>

<kbng:paragraph>Into the garden presently came some little children, and threw bread and cake 
into the water. </kbng:paragraph> 

<kbng:paragraph><kbng:speech>“See,” </kbng:speech>cried the youngest, <kbng:speech>“there is a new one;”</kbng:speech> and the rest were delighted, 
and ran to their father and mother, dancing and clapping their hands, and 
shouting joyously, <kbng:speech>“There is another swan come; a new one has arrived.”</kbng:speech> </kbng:paragraph> 

<kbng:paragraph>Then they threw more bread and cake into the water, and said,<kbng:speech> “The new one is 
the most beautiful of all; he is so young and pretty.”</kbng:speech> And the old swans bowed 
their heads before him. </kbng:paragraph> 

<kbng:paragraph>Then he felt quite ashamed, and hid his head under his wing; for he did not 
know what to do, he was so happy, and yet not at all proud. He had been 
persecuted and despised for his ugliness, and now he heard them say he was the 
most beautiful of all the birds. Even the elder-tree bent down its bows into the 
water before him, and the sun shone warm and bright. Then he rustled his 
feathers, curved his slender neck, and cried joyfully, from the depths of his 
heart, <kbng:speech>“I never dreamed of such happiness as this, while I was an ugly 
duckling.”</kbng:speech> </kbng:paragraph>
